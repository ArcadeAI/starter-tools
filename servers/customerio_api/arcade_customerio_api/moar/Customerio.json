The shape of the request changes based on the type of audience you broadcast to: a segment, a list of emails, a list of customer IDs, a map of users, or a data file. You can reference properties in the `data` object from this request using liquid\u2014`{{trigger.<property_in_data_obj>}}`.\n\n**Important**: API-triggered broadcasts can only send messages to people you've already added to your workspace. A broadcast cannot add or identify new people. If you reference people who don't exist in your broadcast audience, the broadcast will fail by default. You can override this behavior by setting the `email_ignore_missing` and/or `id_ignore_missing` flags to `true`. This will cause the broadcast to skip over any people who don't exist, and send to whoever does.\n\nIf your broadcast produces a `422` error, you can [get more information about the errors](#operation/broadcastErrors) to see what went wrong.\n\n**This endpoint is rate-limited to one request every 10 seconds.** After exceeding this, you'll receive a status of 429. Broadcasts are optimized to send messages to a large audience and not for one-to-one interactions. Use our [transactional API](#send-email) or event-triggered campaigns to respond to your audience on an individual, one-to-one basis.\n",

We recommend that you host your CSVs from short-lived URLs. Ideally, your URLs will expire 2 hours after you initiate an import so that your customers' information doesn't remain publicly available after you've uploaded it to us.\n\nCheck out the CSV requirements based on what you're importing: [people](/uploading-people/#csv-requirements), [events](/journeys/uploading-people/#event-csv-requirements), and [objects or relationships](/journeys/import-objects/#csv-requirements).\n\nThis endpoint performs some basic validation on the request and then queues the import for processing. The import happens in multiple stages after your request, and may even fail. You'll need to [lookup the status of the import](#getImport) to check on its progress.\n\nRecords in your CSV might result in errors or warnings during the import. We make the errors and warnings available in CSV files that you can download via our export endpoints. [Lookup your import](#getImport) to get download URLs for error and warning reports.\n",

Provide query parameters to refine the metrics you want to return.\n\nUse the `start_ts` and `end_ts` to find messages within a time range. If your request doesn't include `start_ts` and `end_ts` parameters, we'll return the most recent 6 months of messages. If your `start_ts` and `end_ts` range is more than 12 months, we'll return 12 months of data from the most recent timestamp in your request. Timestamps reflect when deliveries were created in our system, not when they were actually sent to recipients. There may be a delay between creation and sending.\n",
